//! ONE FUNCTION, MANY OPS — the door for a KTIR producer whose function is a whole kernel.
//!
//! # THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES, AND WHOSE PROBLEM IT IS
//!
//! Every entry point in [`super::lower_ktir_to_superdsc`] reads a function's PARAMETER LIST as one
//! op's operands: [`super::lower_ktir_to_superdsc::split_out`] takes the parameter written by a
//! `ktdp.store` as the output, counts the rest as inputs, and refuses when the count is not the
//! body's arity. That is exact for a function that IS one op, which is what `KtirFunc` emits — one
//! program per model-graph node.
//!
//! It is not the only legitimate KTIR. **IBM's C++ toolchain — the reference KTIR producer — puts a
//! whole kernel in ONE function**: its own checked-in output has 3 `linalg.matmul` in one
//! `func.func` for a SwiGLU MLP and 12 in one for a decoder layer. KTIR itself says nothing about
//! how many ops a function holds; a `func.func` holds what it holds. So the arity check is a
//! property of these bodies, not of the IR, and a producer matching the reference shape is refused
//! by a crate that could serve it.
//!
//! # WHY THIS IS PURELY ADDITIVE
//!
//! Nothing here changes an existing entry point, `split_out`, or any assembler. The bodies take
//! `&[Region]` and filter it by `is_out`, so handing a body the regions of ONE OP satisfies
//! `split_out` unmodified. This module's whole job is to build those per-op lists:
//!
//! ```text
//!   regions()            per PARAMETER: view <- parameter,     then the FIRST tile over the view
//!   region_for_operand() per OPERAND:   load <- tile <- view <- parameter, and THAT tile
//! ```
//!
//! The second is strictly more precise. `regions()`'s own comment flags that "a program that tiles
//! one buffer many ways is not addressed through this field"; rooting the walk at the operand reads
//! the window the op actually takes, so that case stops needing a special path.
//!
//! # WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
//!
//! It recognises NOTHING. An op becomes a `Program` only where the mapping is 1:1 by op kind
//! (`linalg.matmul` -> `Matmul`, `math.exp` -> `Elementwise(Exp)`). It does not look for a silu
//! longhand, an rmsnorm shape or an online softmax; a producer that wants `SiluMul` states it by
//! calling that entry point itself. Anything with no 1:1 mapping is REFUSED BY NAME, because a
//! guessed node kind is a well-formed descriptor computing the wrong function.

///
/// This module's header says it recognises NOTHING, and every 1:1 arm in [`program_of`] keeps that
/// promise. This is the one shape where the 1:1 rule cannot be kept, and the reason is a DEVICE fact
/// rather than a convenience: the AIU has `OpFunc::Silu` as a primitive and KTIR's `math.*` set does
/// not, so a producer has no op to write it with and writes the longhand instead
/// ([`Program::SiluMul`]'s own doc says exactly this).
///
/// ⛔⛔⛔ AND LOWERING THE LONGHAND OP-BY-OP IS NOT A SLOWER ANSWER, IT IS A DIFFERENT ONE.
/// `test/fixtures/swiglu_mlp.py` delta 5 states it at the source: "Writing the activation any other
/// way still lowers, but as four plain SuperDSCs computing a DIFFERENT algorithm, to which the
/// derived tolerance would not apply." The device primitive is a sigmoid opaque over six constants;
/// five pointwise descriptors are not that function. So the choice is not "fuse or don't" — it is
/// "recognise it, or emit something whose numbers no tolerance covers". A green `dxp_standalone`
/// exit would not catch the difference, which is what makes this a fail-closed matter.
///
/// # IT PROVES THE MATCH; IT DOES NOT PATTERN-GUESS
///
/// Built on the shape [`super::lower_ktir_to_superdsc::program_rmsnorm_eps`] and
/// `program_scalarmul_scale` already use: walk for an exact op-kind chain, and require every link to
/// be UNIQUE. Two discriminators do the real work, and neither is structural bookkeeping:
///
/// * **the divide's numerator is the value the negate consumed.** `g / (1 + exp(-g))` is
///   `g · sigmoid(g)` = `silu(g)`; `x / (1 + exp(-g))` for any other `x` is a different function
///   that happens to have the same op kinds in the same order. This is what makes it silu.
/// * **the added constant is exactly 1.0.** `sigmoid` is `1/(1+e⁻ˣ)`. Any other constant is a
///   different function, so it is refused rather than rounded into one.
///
/// A chain that almost matches is REFUSED BY NAME, never lowered as the nearest thing.
